# Fuzzy-Logic
- Fuzzy logic is a heuristic approach that allows for more advanced decision-tree processing and better integration with rules-based programming.
- Fuzzy logic is a generalization from standard logic, in which all statements have a truth value of one or zero. In fuzzy logic, statements can have a value of partial truth, such as 0.9 or 0.5.
- Theoretically, this gives the approach more opportunity to mimic real-life circumstances, where statements of absolute truth or falsehood are rare.
- Fuzzy logic may be used by quantitative analysts to improve the execution of their algorithms.
- Because of the similarities with ordinary language, fuzzy algorithms are comparatively simple to code, but they may require thorough verification and testing.
